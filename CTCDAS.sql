It prepares students for success on the AP Literature exam in May, asking students to view literature studied as mentor texts to inspire their own creative efforts. Six units of study parallel those in World Literature (above) but culminating assessments for each unit involve writing creatively as well as mastering the writing tasks on the AP Literature exam. Projects may include multimedia and genre studies, research using MLA style, crafting spoken word and poetry, writing stories and creative nonfiction, and creating podcasts and films. Students review aesthetics and critical schools of thought to examine a work''s structure, style, and themes through a particular lens, and attend to smaller-scale elements of fiction, drama and poetry (e.g. figurative language, symbolism, and tone) as practitioners of the craft rather than merely as literary scholars. Students workshop a portfolio of their own writing by the end of the course, having applied what they learned as critics. Selected texts are chosen from several genres and periods to reflect a survey of World Literature - from the sixteenth century to the twenty-first century. Reading is accompanied by thoughtful discussion and analytical writing. Literature and Composition: An Introduction to Reading and Writing (Jago) is the course anthology.',9,12,'English');
